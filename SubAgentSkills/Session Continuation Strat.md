## 🚀 Next Session Quick Start

### Option A: Continue Immediately (Recommended)

**Execute in new chat**:
```

SYSTEM: Load session continuation for PDKB vault

Previous work:

- Created 5 procedure documents
- Planned action plan execution
- Identified priorities 1-4

Current focus: Execute Priority 1 (Handoff Filing) Reference: ~/PRIORITY-1-HANDOFF-FILING.md

Let's file the handoff documents now.

```

### Option B: Pick Different Priority

**If you want to change focus**:
```

I prefer to focus on Priority 2 (Backup Cleanup) first because [REASON]

Load: ~/PRIORITY-2-BACKUP-CLEANUP.md Status: Ready to execute

Let's start with backup analysis.

```

### Option C: Validate Procedures First

**If you want to review**:
```

Before executing, let me review the procedures:

1. Are the file locations correct for Mac/Windows paths?
2. Should I create additional safety checks?
3. Any adjustments needed to the procedures?

Reference files:

## 🛟 Emergency Recovery

**If session crashes or gets interrupted**:

1. All procedures are saved and documented
2. No changes have been made to vault yet
3. Simply load this document in next session

## 🎬 Copy This Command to Start Next Session

```
Hey Claude! I've got the session materials ready. Let's pick up where we left off.

Session context:
- We completed planning and created 5 procedure documents
- Ready to execute Priority 1: Handoff Document Filing
- All procedures documented and tested
- No breaking changes made yet

Let's start with Priority 1. Should I:
A) Execute the handoff filing procedures directly?
B) Review the procedures first for any adjustments?
C) Jump to a different priority?

I have access to Mac terminal and the vault is synced.
Ready to move fast!
