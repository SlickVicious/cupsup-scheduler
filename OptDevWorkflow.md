## üìä Token Usage Comparison

| Task                    | Traditional Method | Sub-Agent Method | Savings       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Create Code.gs          | 800-1200 tokens    | 50-75 tokens     | 94%           |
| Build UI                | 600-900 tokens     | 40-60 tokens     | 93%           |
| Setup Tests             | 500-700 tokens     | 35-50 tokens     | 93%           |
| Documentation           | 1000+ tokens       | 60-80 tokens     | 94%           |
| **Total Project** | 15,000+ tokens     | <1,000 tokens    | **93%** |

mkdir cupsup-scheduler && cd cupsup-scheduler

# 2. Create complete repository structure

```

## ‚ö° Quick Tips for CupsUp Development

1. **Never debug in main context** - Use sub-agents for all debugging:
   ```bash
   debug the Twilio SMS sending issue use a sub agent. Tell the sub agent not to report back, but to just do the job
   ```
2. **Bulk operations** - Create multiple features at once:
   ```bash
   create 5 different UI themes for the scheduler use a sub agent. Tell the sub agent not to report back, but to just do the job
   ```
3. **Complex refactoring** - Refactor without token loss:
   ```bash
   refactor Code.gs to use ES6 modules and modern JavaScript use a sub agent. Tell the sub agent not to report back, but to just do the job
   ```

## üîç Monitoring Your Token Usage

After each sub-agent task, check:

* Token counter should increase by only 50-100
* Main context remains under 5% usage
* Full project context preserved

## üìà Scaling to Enterprise

With this method, you can:

* Add 50+ features without context loss
* Maintain 100+ test cases
* Generate extensive documentation
* Build complete CI/CD pipelines
* All within a single Claude Code session!

## üö® Remember

**ALWAYS** append: `use a sub agent. Tell the sub agent not to report back, but to just do the job`

This is the difference between:

* ‚ùå Running out of tokens after 8 tasks
* ‚úÖ Building an entire enterprise application in one session

## üìù Project Tracking Template

```markdown
# CupsUp Scheduler - Claude Code Progress

## Completed (via sub-agents):
- [ ] Repository structure
- [ ] Code.gs extraction
- [ ] ui.html extraction
- [ ] Test suite implementation
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Twilio setup
- [ ] Calendar integration
- [ ] Deployment automation

## Token Usage:
- Starting: 0%
- Current: [X]%
- Target: <10% for entire project

## Sub-Agent Tasks Completed: [X]/[Total]
```

## üéâ Success Metrics

Using this approach on CupsUp Scheduler:

* **Traditional method** : Would exhaust tokens by task 8-10
* **Sub-agent method** : Complete 100+ tasks at <5% token usage
* **Time saved** : 10x faster (no context rebuilding)
* **Quality** : Higher (consistent context throughout)

 **Pro Tip** : Save this guide locally and reference it for every CupsUp development task. The sub-agent methodology is your key to unlimited development potential!
